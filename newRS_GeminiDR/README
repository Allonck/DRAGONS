                         GeminiDR package prototype.

The GeminiDR package is designed as a replacement for the legacy 'astrodata_Gemini' 
package. The GeminiDR package prototype provides parameter and primitive classes
through a full inheritance tree for the GMOS instrument. As described in other
documents (The AstroData Package: A New Structure), the package will be accessable
to a new recipe system and is fully available at a programmatic level.

In most cases, the GEMINI level of the hierarchy will be not useful directly, as
real functionality occurs at the "instrument' level, e.g., in this prototype,
GMOS. Users are, of course, able to import and inherit the GEMINI level classes
to their own ends, but demonstration of the usage of the GMOS package is provided 
herein with the GMOS recipe functions, which are found in GMOS/recipes/. The 
prototype IMAGE recipes can be imported from the GMOS package:

    from GMOS.recipes.IMAGE import qaReduce

This 'qaReduce' recipe function, and all recipe functions, is called with one (1) 
parameter passed by a caller, an instance of the GMOS primitive set, PrimitivesGMOS. 
This README will not expose the details of this function's employment and users 
should see that package's README for the programmatic details, which can be found 
in

    GMOS/recipes/README

The following graphs illustrate the class hierarchies of the parameter and
primitive classes, which exhibit tight parallel structure:
