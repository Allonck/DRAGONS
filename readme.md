# Current Status
The software has not yet had its first public release.  The software is undergoing science-worthiness verification and testing.  **Do not use for science**.  To
reduce Gemini science data, please continue to use, for the time being, the
[Gemini IRAF package](https://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/processing-software).

The first public release is currently expected to happen in **October 2019** and
will be able to reduce **imaging data** from Gemini's current instruments.  There
will no spectroscopy support in the first release, though we are working on
that.

For now, please feel free to look around in the code and the documentation
to see what's coming up.

DRAGONS is a platform for the reduction and processing of astronomical data.
The DRAGONS meta-package includes an infrastructure for automation of the
processes and algorithms for processing of astromical data, with focus on the 
reduction of Gemini data.

# Documentation
Documentation on DRAGONS is available on "readthedocs" at:

* https://dragons.readthedocs.io/

There your will find manuals for Astrodata and the Recipe System.  We are
working on adding tutorials too in the near future.
