# This recipe performs the standardization and corrections needed to convert 
# the raw input flat images and processed dark image into a BPM file. The output 
# processed dark is stored on disk using storeProcessedBPM and has a name 
# equal to the name of the first input flat image with "_BPM.fits" appended.
