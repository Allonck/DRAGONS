# This recipe will perform the preparation and corrections
# needed to convert the inputs into a single fringe calibration file.  
# Output is stored in a directory specified by the parameters of the
# storeProcessedFringe primitive with the suffix '_fringe.fits'
# appended to the name of the first input file.
# It is assumed that the input fringes have been overscan, bias, and
# flat corrected.
