----------------------------

`DRAGONS`_ requires several libraries that could be installed individually. You
can have all of them by |installing_astroconda|. Just click the link and follow
the guidelines. It should take no more than ten minutes (if your internet is
fast).

Once you have `AstroConda`_ installed and you have set your new Virtual
Environment, download `DRAGONS`_ and install it. You can find the last release
version in the link below:

Decompress the downloaded file and access it using a (bash) terminal. Make sure
your Virtual Environment is activated. The installation steps are better
explained |installing_dragons|.
