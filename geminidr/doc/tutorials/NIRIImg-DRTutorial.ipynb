    "Found a good, complete dataset.  GN-2015B-Q-31-118.  Small dither and offset to sky because there's a galaxy in the bottom right corner.  It has the darks for the science, no darks for the standard.  It has the standard.  Lamp-on, lamp-off flats.   I'll have to dig for short darks.   H-band.   Certainly worth a try.  It's pretty too.   It's a supernova observation.\n",
