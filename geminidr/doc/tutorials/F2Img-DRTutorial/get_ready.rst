Get Ready
=========

`DRAGONS`_ requires several libraries that could be installed individually but
you can have all of them by `installing AstroConda <https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#getting-started-jump>`_.
Just click the link and follow the guidelines. It should take no more than ten
minutes (if your internet is fast).

Once you have `AstroConda`_ installed and you have set your new Virtual
Environment, you can download `DRAGONS`_ and install it.

You can find the last release version in the link below:

https://github.com/GeminiDRSoftware/DRAGONS/archive/v2.1.0-b1.zip

Decompress the downloaded file and access it using a (bash) terminal. Make sure
your Virtual Environment is activated. The installation steps are better
explained `in this link <https://dragons-recipe-system-users-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.
