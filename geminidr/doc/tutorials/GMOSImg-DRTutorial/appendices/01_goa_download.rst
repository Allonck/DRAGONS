Downloading from the Gemini Observatory Archive
***********************************************

For this tutorial we provide a pre-made package with all the necessary data.
Here we show how one can search and download the data directly from the
archive, like one would have to do for their own program.

If you are just interested in trying out the tutorial, we still
recommended that you download the pre-made package (:ref:`datasetup`) instead
of getting everything manually.
