              The Gemini Observatory gemini_python package
                                RELEASE X1

The X1 release of the gemini_python package, gemini_python-X1.tar.gz, can be 
obtained from the Gemini website, http://gemini.edu .

The gemini_python  package has several dependencies like numpy, astropy, 
and others. All dependencies of gemini_python and astrodata are provide by
the Ureka package, and users are highly encouraged to install and use this very
useful package. It is an easy and, perhaps, best way to get everything you need
and then some. Ureka is available at http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/.

RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION


It is recommended to install the software in a location other than the standard 
python location for modules (the default 'site-packages'). This is also the 
only solution if you do not have write permission to the default 'site-package'. 
Here is how you install the software somewhere other than the default location:

   $ python setup.py install --prefix=/your/favorite/location

'/your/favorite/location' must already exist.  This command will install executable
scripts in a 'bin' subdirectory, the documentation in a 'share' subdirectory,
and the modules in a 'lib/python2.7/site-packages' subdirectory.  The modules being
installed are 'astrodata', 'astrodata_FITS', 'astrodata_Gemini', and 'gempy'.
In this manual, we will only use 'astrodata'.

Because you are not using the default location, you will need to add two paths to
your environment.  You might want to add the following to your .cshrc or 
.bash_profile, or equivalent shell configuration script.

C shell(csh, tcsh):

   setenv PATH /your/favorite/location:${PATH}
   setenv PYTHONPATH /your/favorite/location:${PYTHONPATH}

Bourne shells (sh, bash, ksh, ...) :

   export PATH=/your/favorite/location:${PATH}
   export PYTHONPATH=/your/favorite/location:${PYTHONPATH}

If you added those lines to your shell configuration script, make sure your 
source the file to activate the new setting.

For csh/tcsh::

   $ source ~/.cshrc
   $ rehash

For bash::

   $ source ~/.bash_profile


INSTALL UNDER UREKA

Assuming that you have installed Ureka and that you have write access to the Ureka
directory, this will install 'astrodata' in the Ureka 'site-packages' directory.
WARNING: While easier to install and configure, this will modify your Ureka 
installation.

   $ python setup.py install

This will also add executables to the Ureka bin directory and documentation to 
the Ureka 'share' directory.

With this installation scheme, there is no need to add paths to your environment.
However, it is a lot more complicated to remove the Gemini software in case of
problems, or if you just want to clean it out after evaluation.

In tcsh, you will need to run rehash to pick the new executables written to 
bin.



TEST THE INSTALLATION

Start up the python interpreter and import astrodata::

   $ python
   >>> import astrodata

Next, return to the command line and test that ``reduce`` is reachable 
and runs. There may be some delay as package modules are byte compiled::

   $ reduce -h [--help]

This will print the reduce help to the screen.
