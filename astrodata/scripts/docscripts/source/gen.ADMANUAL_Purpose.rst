Document Purpose
----------------

This document is the user manual for the "astrodata" software, which
is provided as part of the Gemini Data Processing Suite currently
being deployed at Gemini. This system includes the AstroData data
handling class for MEFs, as well as the the Astrodata "Recipe System"
which provides automation features. In all, the features described
relate to three installed packages, one which contains the base
Astrodata source code and two which contain configurations (including
code) used to handle data intelligently based on the type of dataset
it represents.


Intended Audience
-----------------

This document is intended for users of the astrodata package in
general, given any configuration of datatypes. Examples refer to the
astrodata_Gemini configuration, and use Gemini definitions for dataset
types, high level meta-data handlers, and definitions of primitive
dataset transformations. specific Readers should in most cases begin
with the AstroData User Tutorial, which can be found here
`http://nihal.hi.gemini.edu/LINK_TO_AD_TUTORIAL
<http://nihal.hi.gemini.edu/LINK_TO_AD_TUTORIAL>`__, for a quick
introduction to the concepts involved using Gemini data. This document
gives a more complete and detailed picture, emphasizing how the system
works.
