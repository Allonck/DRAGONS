What is AstroData?
==================
.. todo::
   Describe AstroData in a language that astronomer will comprehend.
   
.. note::
   For the TODO: use language a scientist will comprehend.  then either refer to the programmer's reference
   or add a section clearly advertised to programmers.  the idea is that we don't want to lose
   the scientists, but if some readers are more technically oriented we also want to make sure
   they get the info they are after.

Installing AstroData
====================
.. todo::
   List pre-requisites. Instructions how to build, install, configure. Both 'astrodata' and 'gemini_python'.

.. note::
   examples require numpy, scipy, stsci.numdisplay, astropy.  installing Ureka takes care of that.

AstroData Support
=================
.. todo::
   Refer to online webpages (once they exist).  Refer to Gemini helpdesk system for help.
