What are Descriptors?
*********************

Descriptors are designed such that essential keyword values that describe a
particular concept can be accessed from the headers of any dataset in a
consistent manner, regardless of which instrument was used to obtain the
data. This is particularly useful for Gemini data, since the majority of
keywords used to describe a particular concept at Gemini are not uniform
between the instruments.
